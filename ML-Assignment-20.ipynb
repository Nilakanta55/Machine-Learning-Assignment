    "“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly used in classification problems. In the SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiates the two classes very well. Support Vectors are simply the co-ordinates of individual observation. The SVM classifier is a frontier which best segregates the two classes (hyper-plane/ line)."

Advantage of scaling is to avoid attributes in greater numeric ranges dominating those in smaller numeric ranges. Another advantage is to avoid numerical difficulties during the kernel calculation."

By using this techniques, we can add the predict_proba() and predict_log_proba() methods to the SVM model."

The computational complexity of the primal form of the SVM problem is proportional to the number of training instances m, while the computational complexity of the dual form is proportional to a number between m2 and m3. So if there are millions of instances, you should definitely use the primal form, because the dual form will be much too slow. The dual problem is faster to solve than the primal when the number of training instances is smaller than the number of features"

Increasing gamma makes the bell-shape curve narrower, and as a result each instance's range of influence is smaller: the decision boundary ends up being more irregular, wiggling around individual instances. Conversely, a small gamma value makes the bell-shaped curve wider, so instances have a larger range of influence, and the decision boundary ends up smoother. A smaller C value leads to a wider street but more margin violations."
